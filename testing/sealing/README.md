# Sealing test report

## Goal
The turtles can swim very deep where the pressure is high, that is why the cases have to resist water under high pressure to protect the electronics inside. We put our cases into a pressure container to see which material and which sealing resists water best.

## Equipment
* Pressure container

## Testing
To test how the cases can handle pressure in water we used a pressure container.

The container was filled half way up with water. The tested cases were assembled and put on the bottom of the container fully covered with water. Weights had to be attached so the cases stayed static on the bottom of the container during the test. The container was sealed with the cover and a circlip and the air hose was attached. The cases were tested under 9 bars of pressure for 15 min. Afterwards they were taken out and the backplate was unscrewed from the rest of the case very carefully so no water from the outside of the case would flow inside accidently.

## Results
* Polyoxymethylene (POM) - foamed polyurethan O-ring string

The case was wet on the backplate and on the inside. There was water already flowing out while unscrewing the backplate so it can be assumed there was a lot of water inside.

* Polyoxymethylene (POM) - rubber O-ring string

The only case without any wet spots on the inside. This case didn't have screws on the top which could be a reason why it stayed dry. Also the thread on one of the backplate screws got broken but it didn't effect the water resistance of the case.

* Polyoxymethylene (POM) - polyurethan sealing sheet

There was a very small wet spot at one of the top screws but it has already disappeared at the time of taking the picture so it's not visible.

* Oleamide - polyurethan sealing sheet

Of all the cases with a polyurethan sealing sheet this one was the wettest. There were big wet spots on the inside of the case.

* Polyamide 6 (PA6) - polyurethan sealing sheet

It only had a tiny spot at one of the screws which is visible on the picture.

* Acryl - hard polyurethan sealing layer

It was already visible from the outside that a lot of water penetrated the case during the testing.

* Polyoxymethylene (POM) - O-ring string

Second try with the same POM case with the O-ring sealing we used before, only this time it had screws on the top. It was still completely dry even with the screws.

## Conclusion
* The acrylic with hard polyurethan sealing layer and the POM with polyurethan O-ring sealing string cases leaked a lot of water.
* The ones with the polyurethan sealing sheet between leaked a little. It might have also leaked at the screws on top because it was wet mainly near the screws.
* The case with the O-ring sealing string held up best without any leaking.

At first we suspected that the screws on top could have something to do with the leaking because the wet spots were often near the screws. Since the only completely dry case was the POM with the O-ring sealing which didn't have holes on top, we made new holes into the case to determine if the screws are the reason of leaking. The results show that the case stayed dry even after we drilled the holes which means that the sealings were the leaking reason of all the tests where it leaked.
