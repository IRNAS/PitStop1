# High pressure sealing test report

## Goal
After the right material and sealing method were selected, the sealing under high pressure had to be tested as well. For testing we have made a new series of two enclosures, one PitStop Tag enclosure and one PitStop Camera enclosure. We have used polyamide for enclosures and rubber O-ring string for sealing. Enclosures were put under high pressure up to 25 bar, equal to the depth of 250m.

## Testing
We again used a pressure container to test the sealing of the enclosures. Tests were similar to the first sealing tests. The tested cases were assembled and put on the bottom of the container fully covered with water. The container was sealed with a cover and a circlip and the air hose from the high pressure air tank was connected.

The cases were first tested under 10 and 25 bars of pressure for 15 minutes. The next test was conducted at 50 bars. The last test was conducted at 25 bars for a few hours to test longer exposure to high pressure. After each test cases were taken out of the container and wiped. The lid was removed from the rest of the case to check for any leaks.

## Results
Both cases, Tag and Camera enclosures, stayed completely dry at 10 and 25 bar.

When tested at 50 bar, slight deformation was found on both aluminium lids and on Camera enclosure. But despite the deformation, both cases stayed completely dry, even at 50 bar.

The last test that we conducted was at 25 bars for a few hours. Even at longer exposure to high pressure, both cases stayed completely dry.

## Conclusion
Both cases, PitStop Tag enclosure and PitStop Camera enclosure passed all tests. Even at 50 bar, when both cases have undergone permanent deformation, they stayed completely dry. This confirms our choice of rubber O-ring string for sealing.
