# Testing enclosures

To determine what material and what sealing to use for the enclosure we've done a series of tests:

1) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/leaking">_**Leaking Test**_</a>
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with different sealings in a pressure container to see if water leaks in under high pressure

2) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/leaking">_**Hardness Test**_</a>
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with a pendulum like construction to see which material survives best on impact with high momentum
