# Testing enclosures

1) _**Leaking Test**_
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with different sealings in a pressure container to see if water leaks in under high pressure

2) _**Hardness Test**_
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with a pendulum like construction to see which material survives best on impact with high momentum
