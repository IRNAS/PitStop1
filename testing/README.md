# Testing enclosures

The sea turtle regularly cleans its shell by rubbing it at rocks. To sustain the high forces that can occur, the material the enclosure is made of must have high durability. Since the turtle spends most of the time underwater and dives up to 200m deep, the enclosures also have to survive and keep water away under very high pressure. To determine what material and what sealing to use for the enclosure to protect its inside components under those circumstances, we've done a series of tests:  


1) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/sealing">_**Sealing Test**_</a>
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with different sealings in a pressure container to see if water leaks in under high pressure

<br />

2) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/durability">_**Durability Test**_</a>
  * testing enclosures made of different materials with a pendulum like construction to see which material survives best on impact with high momentum

<br />

3) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/high%20pressure%20sealing">_**High Pressure Sealing Test**_</a>
  * testing PitStop Tag and Camera enclosures under high pressure up to 25 bar, equal to the depth of 250m

<br />

4) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/high%20pressure%20durability">_**High Pressure Durability Test**_</a>
  * testing PitStop Camera enclosures under high pressure and observing deformations on the enclosures

<br />

5) <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing/pressure%20sensor">_**Pressure Sesnsor Sealing Test**_</a>
  * testing the sealing of the pressure sensor for PitStop Tags
