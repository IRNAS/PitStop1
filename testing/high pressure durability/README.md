# High pressure durability test report

## Goal
In the high pressure sealing test we were testing the sealing of the encosures under hight pressure but when we exposed the enclosure to 50 bar of pressure we have noticed a large deformation of the case that had to be further investigated. We have used PitStop Camera enclosures made from polyoxymethylene (POM) and polyethylene (PE) plastics.  Enclosures were put under high pressure up to 25 bar, equal to the depth of 250m.

## Testing
We again used a pressure container to test the sealing of the enclosures. Tests were similar to the first sealing tests. The tested cases were assembled and put on the bottom of the container fully covered with water. The container was sealed with a cover and a circlip and the air hose from the high pressure air tank was connected.

The cases were first tested under 10 and 25 bars of pressure for 15 minutes. The next test was conducted at 50 bars. The last test was conducted at 25 bars for a few hours to test longer exposure to high pressure. After each test cases were taken out of the container and wiped. The lid was removed from the rest of the case to check for any leaks.
