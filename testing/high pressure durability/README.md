# High pressure durability test report

## Goal
During the high pressure sealing test we were testing the sealing of the encosures under hight pressure but when we exposed the enclosure to 50 bar of pressure we have noticed a large deformation of the case that had to be further investigated. We have used PitStop Camera enclosures made from polyoxymethylene (POM) and polyethylene (PE) plastics.  Enclosures were put under high pressure up to 25 bar, equal to the depth of 250m.

## Testing
We again used a pressure container to test the sealing of the enclosures. Tests were similar to the sealing tests. The tested cases were assembled and put on the bottom of the container fully covered with water. The container was sealed with a cover and a circlip and the air hose from the high pressure air tank was connected.

The POM cases were tested under 10 and 25 bar of pressure for 30 minutes while the PE cases were tested under 5 and 8 bar of pressure for 30 minutes, 1 and 16 hours. After each test cases were taken out of the container and wiped. The deformation was measured using a depth gage.

## Results
* Polyoxymethylene (POM) plastics - 10 bar of pressure for 30 minutes

There was no noticable deformation.

* Polyethylene (PE) plastics - 5 bar of pressure for 30 minutes

We have measured a maximum 1.1 mm deformation at the top middle of the case.

* Polyethylene (PE) plastics - 8 bar of pressure for 30 minutes

We have measured a maximum 1.1 mm deformation at the top middle of the case.

* Polyethylene (PE) plastics - 8 bar of pressure for 1 hour

We have measured a maximum 1.6 mm deformation at the top middle of the case.

* Polyethylene (PE) plastics - 8 bar of pressure for 16 hours

We have measured a maximum 5.4 mm deformation at the top middle of the case. Unfortunatelly no image of this test is available.

## Conclusion
While enclosure made from from polyoxymethylene (POM) passed both tests, we discoved that the enclosure made from polyethylene (PE) was a lot weaker. Test under only 8 bar showed a large deformation and we have therefore concluded that PE is not suitable for PitStop Tag and Camera enclosures if the design remains unchanged. If we would increase the wall thickness PE could be suitable as well but more test sould be conducted to confirm that.
