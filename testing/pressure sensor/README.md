# Pressure sensor sealing test report

## Goal
For accurate tracking of the sea turtles the information about the depth is very important. A pressure sensor will be used in the PitStop Tags to measure the depth. Sealing tests of the pressure sensor were similar to the sealing tests of the PitStop Tag enclosures. A special enclosure was made from polyoxymethylene (POM) plastics and rubber O-ring string and a O-ring gasket were used for sealing. Enclosure with the pressure sensor was put under high pressure up to 10 bar, equal to the depth of 100m.

## Testing
To test how the pressure sensor can handle the pressure in water we used a pressure container.

The container was filled half way up with water. The tested enclosure was assembled and put on the bottom of the container fully covered with water. The container was sealed with the cover and a circlip and the air hose was attached. The enclosure with the pressure sensor was tested under 10 bars of pressure for 60 min. Afterwards it was taken out and the backplate was unscrewed from the rest of the case very carefully so no water from the outside of the case would flow inside accidently.

## Results
During the assmebly the pressure sensor was damaged when inserted into the splecial enclosure due to the incorrect O-ring size. Because of the damage the water was able to penetrate the pressure sensor and the sealing test was unsuccessful. The sealing test will therefore have to be repeated with the correct O-ring size and a new pressure sensor.

## Conclusion
The prescribed sealing method for the pressure sensor could not be tested because the sensor was damage during the assembly. Because of the damage the water was able to penetrate the pressure sensor and the sealing test was unsuccessful. The sealing test will therefore have to be repeated with the correct O-ring size and a new pressure sensor.
