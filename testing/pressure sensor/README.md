# Pressure sensor sealing test report

## Goal
For accurate tracking of the sea turtles the information about the depth is very important. To measure the depth a pressure sensor will be used in the PitStop Tags. To test the sealing of the pressures sensor tests were similar to the sealing tests of the PitStop Tag enclosures. A special enclosure was made from polyoxymethylene (POM) plastics and rubber O-ring string and a O-ring gasket were used for sealing. Enclosure with the pressure sensor was put under high pressure up to 10 bar, equal to the depth of 100m.
