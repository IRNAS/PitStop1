# PitStop1 - Open source turtle tag and turtle camera enclosure
PitStop1 is open source turtle tag enclosure we developed in collaboration with [Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/). Turtle tags are used to track the movement of turtles and collect the information necessary to design better strategies for their conservation.

In this repository you can find all technical documentation for the latest version of the turtle tag enclosure and the turtle camera enclosure. The documentation for the version 1 of Pitstop1 is available in the branch [version-1](https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/version1).

Read [an article about the open source turtle tags and the development process](https://www.wildlabs.net/resources/case-studies/how-open-source-technologies-could-dramatically-reduce-cost-tagging-green-sea) and get in touch with [us at Institute IRNAS](http://irnas.eu) for customization and orders.

#### Testing

The enclosure has to sustain in extreme circumstances while mounted on the turtle, such as being hit by rocks, the turtle rubbs its shell at, or hihg pressure at depths up to 200m. To determine what material and sealing to use for the enclosure we did a series of <a href="https://github.com/IRNAS/PitStop1/tree/master/testing">tests</a>.
